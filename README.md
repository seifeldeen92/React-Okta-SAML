# Simple React and Express app SAML login by Okta 

This is a very simple integration to demonstrate SSO via SAML [Okta](https://www.okta.com/)

## Features

- Save user if authenticated
- Redirect user to Okta login if user not authenticated to access our app

## Tech

This project uses:

- [React] - For the client side 
- [node.js] - Evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - node.js framework
- [Passport] - Authentication middleware for our API 
- [Passport SAML] - This is a SAML 2.0 authentication provider for Passport 

## Installation

App requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

#### Install Server
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server on port `5000`.

```sh
cd server
yarn install
yarn dev
```
in another terminal window
```sh
cd server
yarn watch
```

#### Install Client
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the client on port `3000`.

```sh
cd client
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Setup Okta App
Go to [Okta developer](https://developer.okta.com/) and signup or signin. After you signin, you need to create an application from the left sidebar. 

#### How to Configure SAML 2.0 for your Application
```
Single sign on URL: http://localhost:5000/login/callback
Audience URI (SP Entity ID): http://localhost:5000
Name ID format: EmailAddress
Application username: Okta username
```
After you finish this step, you will need to copy `Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL` and `X.509 Certificate` found after you click on **View Setup Instructions**.Afterwards, add your copied `Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL` to the `entryPoint` property in `config.ts` under `saml` property, then add your application's `X.509 Certificate` in `saml.pem`.
